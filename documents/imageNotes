6. Components of an Image Processing System
• Image sensors: physical device that is sensitive to the
energy radiated by the object we wish to image.
• Specialized hardware: digitizer plus hardware that
performs other primitive operations.
• Computer: general-purpose computer.
• Software: consists of specialized modules that perform
specific tasks.
• Mass storage capability: when dealing with
thousands, or even millions, of images, providing
adequate storage in an image processing system can be a
challenge.
• Image displays: are mainly color monitors.
• Hardcopy: devices for recording images (include laser
printers, film cameras, heat-sensitive devices, inkjet
units, and digital units, such as CD-ROM disks).
• Networking: image transmission.
